Grammer rules
For Notes, you can write note with the grammer as python.
And for main data, you can write them as the grammer of CPP.
And for the seed infomation, you need copy and complete this model

{
	"FileName" = "SavingImageArray.KZK or ImageName.png(and so on)",
	"Upground" = [a1, b1], [a2, b2], [a3, b3] (and so on),
	"Background" = [a1, b1], [a2, b2], [a3, b3] (and so on),
}

The system will confident the root automaticlly.

In the future, this file also become the output file of CNN or other auto seed
choose algorithm.
